Identify the Scandinavian languages

This project is not finished. The REST API is not completed and the app is not dockerized.
Ignore the CSS, HTML, and JS files as they are not finished.

The data is in a winzip file. It must be extracted to be on the correct pathway for the python files.

The file predict.py contains a function 'predict' that allows the user to input a sentence.
The function then returns which language it thinks the sentence is.

The file scandi_main.py contains all the functions and code used to parse and prepare the data, create and train the neural network, and begins the solution process.

A Jupyter Notebook is also included to showcase the steps of the project is an easy to understand way.
